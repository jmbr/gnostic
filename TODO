Pending tasks in the development of gnostic
===========================================

- Entering parameters as name=value is sometimes annoying.  Find the way to fix
  this.

- Improve variable implementation (allow expansions, etc).

- It is possible to do cyclic includes in task files.  This fails with a
  message due to file descriptor starvation but it should fail more gracefully.

- Rearrange the hash table.

- Write an unit test for the include feature.  Another one to check for
  environment vars GNOSTIC_*

- Add support for specifying different shells from the command line.

- Write exhaustive documentation (info pages).

- Perhaps it would be interesting to introduce a wildcard `*' rule.

- Convert manual pages to docbook format.
